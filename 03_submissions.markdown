To ensure a high-quality technical session, submissions must cover one of the proposed [workshop topics](/hyperagents2025/topics/). We solicit two types of papers:
* regular papers should present innovative research, a critical survey on a relevant topic, or an application to a real-world use case (max. 16 pages, CEURART style format);
* short papers should present a vision, novel and promising ideas in an early stage of development, or should demonstrate new and promising technology (max. 8 pages, CEURART style format).

All research papers must be original, prior unpublished work, and not under review elsewhere. All submissions will undergo a **single-blind reviewing process** (submissions are not anonymous, reviews will be) and will be selected based on originality, merit, and relevance to the workshop. Accepted papers will be published in a CEUR-WS volume. Submission requires at least one author to present the paper in person at the workshop. Where applicable, we encourage the authors of accepted papers to bring and demonstrate a prototype at the workshop.

Please submit papers through EasyChair: TBA.
