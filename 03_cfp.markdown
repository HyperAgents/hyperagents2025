<p style="color:red;">Note: Papers currently under review for ECAI 2025 cannot be submitted to the workshop. If rejected from ECAI 2025, you may request to consider your paper for inclusion in the HyperAgents 2025 program. Please send your request, including the ECAI 2025 reviews, to [hyperagents2025@easychair.org](mailto:hyperagents2025@easychair.org) by **July 31, 2025**.</p>

The impressive wave of recent advances in Generative AI has brought new capabilities and renewed interest in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems—with many new frameworks available for rapid prototyping, for example, using agentic workflows based on language models. Furthermore, progress in the [Web of Things](https://www.w3.org/WoT/wg/){:target="_blank"} and [Distributed Knowledge Graphs](https://cost-dkg.eu/){:target="_blank"} is now turning the Web into a homogeneous hypermedia fabric that extends to the physical world to interconnect everything—devices, information resources, abstract concepts, etc. The latest standards allow autonomous agents not only to browse and query but also to observe and act on this hypermedia fabric. These advancements implement several visionary ideas expressed in the motivating scenarios from the [original Semantic Web paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3591366.3591376){:target="_blank"}—and unlock [new practical use cases and perspectives](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3306127.3331893){:target="_blank"} for integrating multi-agent systems with the Web.

Central to these developments is the _**flexible, autonomous use of hypermedia**_—for example, to _**discover**_ and _**use**_ knowledge, device functionality, or tools. HyperAgents 2025 invites contributions related to all aspects of enabling and governing systems of autonomous agents in _**open hypermedia environments**_---that is, systems of agents able to _**perceive**_, _**decide**_, and _**act**_ through the Web to _**achieve goals**_. We refer to such systems as **Hypermedia Multi-Agent Systems**.

The primary objective of this workshop is to establish a common forum for both the AI and Web communities with a focus on autonomous agents on the Web—and to create social, conceptual, and technological bridges across these fields. We invite researchers and practitioners to imagine, design, build, evaluate, and share their thoughts and visions on the future of the Web for both people and autonomous agents.

The workshop is the fourth event in a series of events after the [Dagstuhl Seminar 23081](https://www.dagstuhl.de/23081){:target="_blank"} (Feb. 2023), [Dagstuhl Seminar 21702](https://www.dagstuhl.de/21072){:target="_blank"} (Feb. 2021), and [HyperAgents 2019](http://www2019.hyperagents.org){:target="_blank"} (Feb. 2019). We intend to co-locate the workshop with a face-to-face meeting of the [W3C WebAgents Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webagents/){:target="_blank"}.

## Scope and Topics

HyperAgents 2025 invites contributions to all aspects of enabling and governing systems of autonomous agents in open hypermedia environments. We refer to such systems as Hypermedia Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). While the range of topics is broad, contributions should address issues related to the run-time, flexible, and autonomous use of hypermedia and Web environments.

Submissions that do not address a scientific challenge within this scope or merely use the Web as a technology will be desk-rejected. Examples of submissions considered out of scope include applications based on datasets acquired through the Web, conversational agents available through Web interfaces, etc.

The themes and topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

#### Architectural Design of Hypermedia MAS
* Models and architectures for Hypermedia MAS
* Specification and enactment of interaction protocols for hypermedia agents
* Identification and embodiment of agents on the Web
* Decentralization and distributed AI on the Web

#### Autonomous Agents in Hypermedia MAS
* Architectures, models, and programming languages for hypermedia agents
* Learning, reasoning, and neuro-symbolic approaches for hypermedia agents
* Language model-based agents, tool use, and navigation in hypermedia environments
* Knowledge graphs for hypermedia agents

#### Governance in Hypermedia MAS
* Representing and reasoning about policies and norms on the Web
* Norm-aware hypermedia agents
* Accountable and trustworthy hypermedia agents
* Open and scalable organizations and institutions of agents on the Web

#### Hybrid Communities (People &amp; Autonomous Agents)
* Web-based collaboration between various forms of intelligence
* Hybrid social constructs for supporting autonomous reasoning and interaction
* Collective programming, training, customization, and maintenance of Hypermedia MAS
* Interaction among people and hypermedia agents based on natural language and/or mixed reality

#### Frameworks, Tooling, and Applications of Hypermedia MAS
* Programming frameworks, platforms, benchmarks, and other tooling for agents in hypermedia environments
* Applications of Hypermedia MAS for the Web of Things (collaborative robots, industrial manufacturing, building automation, smart grids, etc.)
* Applications of Hypermedia MAS for enhanced social media (mitigating fake news propagation, online bullying, etc.)
* Applications of Hypermedia MAS for enhanced linked research (e.g., curating, sharing, and maintaining corpora and datasets)

## Submissions

Submission website: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hyperagents2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hyperagents2025){:target="_blank"}

Submissions must cover one of the proposed workshop topics to ensure a high-quality technical session. We solicit two types of papers:
* **regular papers**: should present innovative research, a critical survey on a relevant topic, or an application to a real-world use case (max. 12 pages excl. references and annexes, [CEURART style format](https://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html#CEURART){:target="_blank"});
* **short papers**: should present a vision, novel and promising ideas in an early stage of development, or should demonstrate new and promising technology (max. 6 pages excl. references and annexes, [CEURART style format](https://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html#CEURART){:target="_blank"}).

Additional materials can be published online or uploaded as a ZIP archive via EasyChair.

All research papers must be original, unpublished work and not under review elsewhere. All submissions will undergo a **single-blind reviewing process** (submissions are not anonymous, reviews will be) and will be selected based on originality, merit, and relevance to the workshop. Accepted papers will be submitted for publication in a CEUR-WS volume. Submission requires at least one author to present the paper in person at the workshop. Where applicable, we encourage the authors of accepted papers to bring and demonstrate a prototype at the workshop.
