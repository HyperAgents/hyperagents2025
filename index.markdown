<h1>2nd Workshop on Hypermedia Multi-Agent Systems</h1>

<div style="margin-top: -10px;">
	<p>In conjunction with <a href="https://ecai2025.org/" target="_blank">ECAI 2025</a> - Bologna, October 25-30, 2025</p>
</div>

The impressive wave of recent advances in Generative AI has brought new capabilities and renewed interest in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems—with a plethora of frameworks available to build applications based on language models. Furthermore, progress in the [Web of Things](https://www.w3.org/WoT/wg/) and [Distributed Knowledge Graphs](https://cost-dkg.eu/) is now turning the Web into a homogeneous hypermedia fabric that interconnects everything—devices, information resources, abstract concepts, etc. Central to these developments is the flexible, autonomous use of hypermedia—for example, to discover and use knowledge, device functionality, or tools. The latest standards allow software agents not only to browse and query but also to observe and act on this hypermedia fabric. These advancements implement several visionary ideas expressed in the motivating scenarios from the [original Semantic Web paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3591366.3591376)—and unlock [new practical use cases and perspectives](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3306127.3331893) for integrating multi-agent systems with the Web.

The primary objective of this workshop is to establish a common forum for both the AI and Web communities—and to create social, conceptual, and technological bridges across these fields. We invite researchers and practitioners to imagine, design, build, evaluate, and share their thoughts and visions on the future of the Web for both people and autonomous agents.

The workshop is the fourth event in a series of events after the [Dagstuhl Seminar 23081](https://www.dagstuhl.de/23081) (Feb. 2023), [Dagstuhl Seminar 21702](https://www.dagstuhl.de/21072) (Feb. 2021), and [HyperAgents 2019](http://www2019.hyperagents.org) (Feb. 2019). We intend to co-locate the workshop with a face-to-face meeting of the [W3C WebAgents Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webagents/).
