HyperAgents 2025 invites all contributions to Web-based agents and multi-agent systems (MAS). While the range of topics is broad, contributions should address issues related to the flexible, autonomous use of hypermedia and Web environments. We refer to such systems as Hypermedia MAS. The themes and topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

#### Architectural Design of Hypermedia MAS
* Models and architectures for Hypermedia MAS
* Specification and enactment of interaction protocols
* Identification and embodiment of agents on the Web
* Decentralization and distributed AI on the Web

#### Autonomous Agents in Hypermedia MAS
* Architectures, models, and programming languages
* Learning, reasoning, and neuro-symbolic approaches
* Language model-based agents, tool use, and navigation
* Knowledge graphs for autonomous agents

#### Governance in Hypermedia MAS
* Representing and reasoning about policies and norms
* Norm-aware hypermedia agents
* Accountable and trustworthy hypermedia agents
* Open and scalable organizations and institutions of agents on the Web

#### Hybrid Communities (People &amp; Autonomous Agents)
* Hybrid social constructs for supporting autonomous reasoning and interaction
* Collective programming, training, customization, and maintenance of Hypermedia MAS
* Mixed reality for Hypermedia MAS (e.g., interactions, monitoring, configuration)
* Web-based collaboration between various forms of intelligence

#### Frameworks, Tooling, and Applications of Hypermedia MAS
* Programming frameworks, platforms, and other tooling
* Benchmarks for Language Model-based Agents
* Hybrid communities in the Web of Things (industrial manufacturing, building automation, smart grids, etc.)
* Hybrid communities for enhanced social media (mitigating fake news propagation, online bullying, etc.)
* Hybrid communities for enhanced linked research (e.g., curating, sharing, and maintaining corpora and datasets)
